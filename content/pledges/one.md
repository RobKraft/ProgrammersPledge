### I pledge to write code that:

* will not error right away for all users when they try to run it
* will not contain misspellings in the messages visible to users
* will allow users to tab through the fields in the correct (a reasonable) order
* places the focus on the first field in the form when first opened
* resizes controls appropriately when the form is resized
* uses consistent form colors across forms
* uses consistent form elements (button captions and placement) across forms
* uses consistent keyboard shortcuts per policy
* uses consistent form icons and captions, including popup messages across forms
* allows captions will fit on buttons so text won’t get truncated on screen
* runs fast
* won't raise errors because I forgot to handle a potential case of null (missing) data
* will gracefully handle errors with a user friendly message and helpful debugging details will be logged
* I tested the code myself, But if there are any conditions/scenarios I have not tested, I will let you know what those are. (I didn’t test on the Ipad, or against an Oracle database)
* uses complete sentences in error messages
* shows all list data in alphabetic order.

### I also pledge that:

* I won’t ask testers to start testing until all these above items are correct.
